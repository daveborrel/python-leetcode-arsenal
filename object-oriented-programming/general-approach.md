# General Approach to OOP Design

1. Generate Use Cases
2. Constaints Analysis
3. Basic Design
4. Identify Bottlenecks
5. Scalability

# Generate Use Cases

- This part will generally be a collaborative process. 
- Propose some initial use cases and ask the interviewer for feedback.

# Constraints Analysis

- Identify system limitations
- Performance expectations
- Storage Requirements
- Security and Privacy Requirements
- Time budget

# Basic Design

- Main entities classes
- Define attributes and behaviours of each class
- Draw class diagrams
- Define interfaces and abstract classes
- Design data models
- API contracts
- Applicable Design Patterns

# Identify Bottlenecks

# Scalability

- Design for horizontal scaling
- Consider Vertical Scaling
- Load balancing strategies
- Design for data partitioning/sharding
- Caching
- Database Scaling
- Microservices architecture if possible
- Planning for future extensibility
