# Here's what the decision tree would look like for [1, 2, 3]:

# Start with an empty subset [].
# Choose whether to include 1 or not, resulting in subsets [] and [1].
# For each of these subsets, choose whether to include 2, leading to [], [1], [2], and [1, 2].
# Finally, for each of these, choose whether to include 3, ending with [], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3].
