# DFS

- This is a way to traverse a tree or a graph where we use backtracking as the primary method for traversal.

### Different types of traversal on the binary search tree

- In all examples, we go as deep as we can go before backtracking. The only reason we have differences in the output is the order that we return to out function call stack.

### In Order Traversal

- Left, Root, Right

### Pre Order Traversal

- Root, Left, Right
