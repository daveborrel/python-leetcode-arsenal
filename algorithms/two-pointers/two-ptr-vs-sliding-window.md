# Sliding Window vs Two Pointer Approach

### Sliding Window
- Works best when you need to find a continuous sequence of something
- Usually moving both pointers in the right direction
- Common Examples
    - Finding longest substring with K distinct characters
    - Maximum sum subarray of size K
    - Minimum window containing all characters of another string

### Two Pointers
- You need to consider elements from opposite ends of the array
- Move pointers towards one another
- looking for combinations of elements
- Common examples
    - container with most water
    - 3sum
    - trapping rain water

### Helpful Tips
- If the numbers/elements are far apart, it usually means it a two pointer approach.
